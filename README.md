# General Code Solutions

This a repository of solutions for various problems you can find on websites such as LeetCode, HackerRank, etc.

## Organization

The solutions for the various websites are put into folders of their namesake and then organized by problem name, date of solution creation, and the language that the solution was written in.

When space complexity is given, it is auxiliary space complexity, the space complexity taken only by the algorithm and not by the inputs.
