# General Code Solutions

This a repository of solutions for various problems you can find on websites such as LeetCode, HackerRank, etc.

## Getting Started

The solutions for the various websites are put into folders of their namesake and then organized by problem name, date of solution creation/revision, and the language that the solution was written in.

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.
